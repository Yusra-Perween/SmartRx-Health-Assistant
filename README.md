# HealthAssist – Machine Learning Health Recommendation System

HealthAssist is a machine learning based project designed to analyze user health data
and provide basic predictions related to common medical conditions. The goal of this
project is to demonstrate the practical application of ML models in healthcare.

## Project Objectives
- To apply machine learning techniques on health-related datasets
- To predict possible medical conditions based on input features
- To provide a simple and understandable health recommendation workflow

## Key Features
- ML-based disease prediction
- Multiple trained models for different health conditions
- Flask-powered web interface
- Clean and modular Python code structure

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## Project Structure
- `app.py` – Main Flask application
- `train_model.py` – Model training logic
- `datasets/` – CSV files used for training
- `models/` – Saved trained ML models
- `requirements.txt` – Project dependencies

## How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run the application  
   `python app.py`

## Note
This project is created for learning and academic purposes and is not intended
